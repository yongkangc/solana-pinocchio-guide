# Solana Pinocchio Examples

This repository contains a collection of Solana programs built using Pinocchio â€” a new, efficient library for developing Solana programs in Rust with minimal dependencies. Each example demonstrates specific use cases and best practices for building Solana programs with Pinocchio.

## Examples

- [Hello World Program](pinocchio-hello-world/README.md): A simple "hello world" program to demonstrate the basics of using Pinocchio.
- [Counter Program](pinocchio-counter/README.md): A program that allows users to manage an on-chain counter.
- [Vault Program](pinocchio-vault/README.md): A secure vault for users to deposit and withdraw SOL.
- [Escrow Program](pinocchio-escrow/README.md): An escrow system that allows users to securely exchange SPL tokens.
- [AMM Program](pinocchio-amm/README.md): A constant product automated market maker (AMM) that lets users provide liquidity, swap tokens, and withdraw funds.


## How to Use

1. Navigate to the individual program directory for detailed instructions.
2. Follow the steps to build, test, and deploy the program.
